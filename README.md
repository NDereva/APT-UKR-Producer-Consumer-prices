# APT-UKR-Producer-Consumer-prices

This project was developed to study the Price Tranmission (A)symmetries in the Ukrainian Food Suply Chains mainly for my PhD thesis. 

Some papers with the results of this project should be published soon. 

I have tried to doublecheck everythinkg to avoid any errors. However I cannot garantee that my code is error/bug free. If you found any flaw or you have a suggestion - please contact me.
