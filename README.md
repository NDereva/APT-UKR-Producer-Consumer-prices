# APT-UKR-Producer-Consumer-prices

This project was developed to study the Price Transmission (A)symmetries in the Ukrainian Food Supply Chains mainly for my PhD thesis. 


Some papers with the results of this project should be published soon.

I have to admit that it is quite messy and hardly readable. 


I have tried to doublecheck everything to avoid any errors. However I cannot grantee that my code is error/bug free. If you found any flaw or you have a suggestion - please contact me.
